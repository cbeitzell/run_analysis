# Run analysis
<p>Data from a test concerning human activity and smartphone recognition was taken and transformed into a tidy data set and placed into a RunAnalysis.txt file.  This code book was created to describe that data set.  It consists of a description of the data, a definition of the variables in the data set, and description of the steps taken to transform the data into a tidy version. </p>

# The Data
<p>To understand the data in the analyzation, it good to understand the original data.  The data was gained from an experiment which was performed on 30 volunteers using the Samsung Galaxy S II. During the test the volunteers were ask to wear the smartphone on their waste and perform 6 activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).  Data was collected from the accelerometers and gyroscopes, capturing 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. From the data 70% was placed into a training set and 30% in to a test set.</p>

<p>A further explained method of the data collection. "The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain." (README.txt,http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00341/HAPT Data Set.zip) </p>

<p>A set of raw inertial signal data was compiled from the different sensor signals, and movement.  This raw data was then compiled into a set (both training and testing), normalized and bound. From these sets the mean and standard deviation variables were taken and then averaged by subject and activity. The frequency mean was not included as one of the mean variables as is a measurement used to find the mean of a frequency. The other mean variables dealt with the mean of the particular sensor signal meansurement in question.</p>

<p>The data is in wide format.  It is order by the Subject, and then Activity.  The Averaged mean and standard deviation variables then follow.</p>

# Transformations

<p>Transforming the data required the joining of several pieces of data.  Before joining the necessary labels and columns needed to be gained.</p>

<p>Read in the raw variable names.</p>
* featureDef <- read.table("features.txt")
<p>Pull out the coulmns numbers and names strictly for mean and standard deviation.</p>
* meanStdList <- featureDef[grepl("^.*mean..$|^.*std..$|^.*mean..-[XYZ]$|^.*std..-[XYZ]$",featureDef$V2, perl = TRUE),]
<p>Convert the variable names into something more meaningful. To do this a simple replacement of key words was used.</p>
* featureDef$V2 <- gsub("^f","Frequency.",gsub("^t","Time.",gsub("[:():]","",featureDef$V2)))
* featureDef$V2 <- gsub("std","Standard.Deviation",gsub("mean","Mean",gsub("[:():]","",featureDef$V2)))
* featureDef$V2 <- gsub("Acc",".Accelerometer",featureDef$V2)
* featureDef$V2 <- gsub("Gyro",".Gyroscope",featureDef$V2)
* featureDef$V2 <- gsub("Jerk",".Jerk",featureDef$V2)
* featureDef$V2 <- gsub("Mag",".Mag",featureDef$V2)
<p>see the reference table for a listing of variable transformations.</p>
- [Variables](#Variables)
<p>next read the list of activity list.</p>
* activityDef <- read.table("activity_labels.txt")
<p>With all of the labels gained, the data sets can be created through the use of a getData function.</p>
* trainDF <- getData("train",featureDef$V2,activityDef,meanStdList)
* testDF <- getData("test",featureDef$V2,activityDef,meanStdList)

<p>The getData function joins the activities list and variable names to the data sets</p>
* getData <- function(dirTT, colN, actDef, msList) {
*        setwd(dirTT)
<p>Read in the data set and add the variable names to all data. using the read.table function was the easiest method for pulling the data into R.  Fread would have been faster, but speed was not a factor, and fread was causing some issues locally.</p>
*        X <- read.table(paste(c("X_",dirTT,".txt"), collapse = ""), col.names = colN)
<p>Read in the activity list for that dataset and translate it to a descriptive name.</p>
*        y <- read.table(paste(c("y_",dirTT,".txt"), collapse = ""))
*        joinY <- join(y,actDef)
<p>Read in the subject list for that data set</p>
*        subject <- read.table(paste(c("subject_",dirTT,".txt"), collapse = ""))
*        setwd("..")
<p>Pull out the mean and std variables from the dataset.</p>
        X <- select(X,msList$V1)
<p>Finally create the new mini tidy data set and return it.
*        returnDF <- cbind(Subject = subject$V1, Activity = joinY$V2, X)
*        return(returnDF)
* }
<p>With the new datasets for training and test, the data can be merged into one set and ordered.</p>
* totalDF <- arrange(rbind(trainDF,testDF), Subject, Activity)
<p>Still this is the full data for every Subject and Activity and needs to be averaged.  To do that the lappy function is used to apply the mean function accross the entire data frame.</p>
* totalDT <- as.data.table(totalDF)[,lapply(.SD,mean), by=list(Subject,Activity)]
* write.table(totalDT, file = "RunAnalysis.txt", row.names = FALSE )
